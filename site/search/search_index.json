This summer, I have been interning at 3M in Minnesota and have been working specifically with data migration. My interest spread from back-end development and data science to public speaking and rhetorical studies. I believe strongly in being well rounded, so I constantly work to learn and grow inside my studies and outside in other opportunities. Work Experience IT Intern on the MDM: Data Migration Team 3M St.Paul, MN May 2019 - Present Undergraduate Research Assistant Center for Healthy Minds Madison, WI September 2018 - Present I spend most of my time at the Center creating psych tasks online for experiments and research. The Center has switched to new psych software recently, so it has been my job to transform old tasks to fit in the new software. On top of that, I also work to create new ways to teach the software to unfamiliar employees. Once experiments have been run, I have written numerous scripts to clean and analyze large amounts of data gathered from the experiments. Student IT Technician UW-Madison Science Hall Help Desk Madison, WI Feburary 2019 - Present Working for the service desk at Science Hall has me opening and answering tickets for students and faculty in the building. Each ticket request allows me to test and grow my computer science skills. During downtime, I would work on replacing parts and setting up lab computers. Sales Supervisor Event Network, Inc. St.Paul, MN May 2017 - August 2017 Moving to a more managerial position was a natural progression from my time at Ace Hardware. I opened and closed the store several days a week while keeping track of inventory and employees during the day. Since I was contracted to work at a seasonal exhibit for the Science Museum of Minnesota, I engaged with a wide array of ages and enjoyed learning new things as much as the customers. Sales Associate Ace Hardware Corporation Lakeville, MN July 2014 - August 2016 I spent most of my time interacting with customers, so I became the first and last face they saw when coming into the store. I always greeted with a smile and helped get customers to the right place or right people, and then I would check them out and make sure they had everything they required. On busier days, I would double as a sales associate and inform each patron on how their specific needs could be satisfied.

We placed 3rd in 2017 and 1st in 2018 at the Upper Midwest Regionals, and particpated in Nationals in 2018 and 2019. Ethics Bowl is a form of debate run by The Association for Practical and Professional Ethics (APPE) where students from all over the country come together to defend practical ethical stances on issues ranging from automation to genetics. The program encourages impromptu speaking as well as critical thinking and team work. Each year, the top 32 teams from over 15 regionals around the country particpate in Nationals to be the best team in the country.

During that time, I spent a year as the Academic Chair of the student organization. I managed the relationship between the organzation and the department and shaped the image of the major projected to students inside and outside the department.

I have created small games, different types of queues and trees, and a personal project where I stored information about all the phyiscal copies of movies I own. I used Eclipse to write the programs. Many of these projects have been lost to time. Reach out if you want more information. C Projects Several of my courses at UW-Madison focused on low level programming. For those courses, I wrote allocators and accessors for both virtual and physical memory, catching interrupts from parallel processes, recreated the ps and make commands, and learned about safe memory sharing between processes. The code was written using VIM and complied using gcc. Reach out if you want more information. Kaggle Projects Classifying Mushrooms This project is based out of this Kaggle competition about classifying mushrooms in specific classes. The ultimate goal is to be able to determine if a mushroom is poisonous or not based off of deterministic features. Unfortunately, there is no easy rule to deciding if a mushroom is safe to eat, so the competition works off the idea of coming up with an accurate model that ideally won't have anyone eating poisonous mushrooms. For this project, I used Python and the libraries pandas, numpy, and sklearn. The code is imported from a kaggle kernal. I use random forests from sklearn to create a machine learning model. For more indepth information about the code, check out the project at my github .","title":"Projects"},{"location":"projects/#java-projects","text":"Though out my college journey, I have done a myriad of projects in java from simple coding problems to complex data structure construction.
