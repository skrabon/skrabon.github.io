## Java Projects 
Though out my college journey, I have done a myriad of projects in java from simple coding problems to complex data structure construction. I have created small games, different types of queues and trees, and a personal project where I stored information about all the phyiscal copies of movies I own. I used Eclipse to write the programs.

Many of these projects have been lost to time. Reach out if you want more information. 


## C Projects  
Several of my courses at UW-Madison focused on low level programming. For those courses, I wrote allocators and accessors for both virtual and physical memory, catching interrupts from parallel processes, recreated the _ps_ and _make_ commands, and learned about safe memory sharing between processes. The code was written using VIM and complied using gcc.

## Kaggle Projects 

<h4> Classifying Mushrooms </h4>

This project is based out of this [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/mushroom-classification) about classifying mushrooms in specific classes. The ultimate goal is to be able to determine if a mushroom is poisonous or not based off of deterministic features. Unfortunately, there is no easy rule to deciding if a mushroom is safe to eat, so the competition works off the idea of coming up with an accurate model that ideally won't have anyone eating poisonous mushrooms.

For this project, I used Python and the libraries pandas, numpy, and sklearn. The code is imported from a kaggle kernal. I use random forests from sklearn to create a machine learning model. For more indepth information about the code, check out the project at my [github](https://github.com/skrabon/Classifying-Mushrooms).
